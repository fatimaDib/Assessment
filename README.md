# Assessment
The assessment consists of an API to be used for opening a new “current account” of already existing  customers.
Requirements
• The API will expose an endpoint which accepts the user information (customerID, initialCredit). 
• Once the endpoint is called, a new account will be opened connected to the user whose ID is 
customerID. 
• Also, if initialCredit is not 0, a transaction will be sent to the new account. 
• Another Endpoint will output the user information showing Name, Surname, balance, and 
transactions of the accounts. 
Bonuses 
• Accounts and Transactions are different services. 
• Frontend (simple one is OK). 
• Attention to CI/CD 
Constraints 
This is a backend assignment and consider layers, abstractions, testability and enterprise-level 
architecture carefully. 
The programming language is C# with .NET Core
Expectations 
The expected deliverable is the source code published on Github or Gitlab and instructions on 
how to execute and test it.
We hope to see demonstration of good git practice and workflow; show us how you work in a 
team. Testability will be also assessed.
Show your knowledge beyond boilerplate endpoints!
